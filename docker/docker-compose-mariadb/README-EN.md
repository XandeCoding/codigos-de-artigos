# Docker Compose - MariaDB

You know when you need to spin up a database to run an API or some project locally, but you don't want to waste time installing and configuring everything on your machine?

The other day, I had to do exactly that. I had a bit of trouble until I got it working, so I decided to share it here ‚Äî maybe it'll save you almost an hour trying to find an error caused by wrong environment variables üòÖ.

This is a script I made to use with Docker Compose. If you don't have Docker installed yet, just go to the [official site](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) ‚Äî they have a great installation guide.

Once it's installed, just save the content below in a file called *`docker-compose.yml`*, run the command `docker-compose up` or `docker compose up`, depending on which version you have installed, in the directory where the file is ‚Äî and done! The database will be running on port 3306 (you can change that, just like the environment variables).

Hope it helps. Thanks and goodbye! ‚úåÔ∏è

```yaml
services:
  bancoMariaDb:
    image: mariadb
    restart: always
    container_name: bancoMariaDb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=web
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=web
```
