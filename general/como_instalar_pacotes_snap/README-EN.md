# How to Install Applications Using Snap

If you've ever tried to install an application on Ubuntu, you know that sometimes it can be really easy. Other times, it can be harder than listening to _Hurt from Johnny Cash_ after getting dumped by your ex 😑.
And that's exactly what Snap was made for. Once you've installed this tool, just open your terminal, search for the app you want to install, and hit install. I know, I said the T-word (terminal 👻), but it's actually easier than I might have made it sound 😂.

**1**. So, open your terminal on any Ubuntu-based distribution and type the following commands:


```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

**2**. By now, you should already have Snap installed -- if everything went well. Let's see what Snap can do. Try typing:

![Alt Text]({{ get_img_url('general/como_instalar_pacotes_snap/assets/snap-find.png')}})

**3**. As you can see, this search retrieves a lot of results, but what we want is our beloved Spotify -- which happens to be the first option.

**4**. If you want to install Spotify, just type:

```
sudo snap install spotify
```

The app will install quickly -- just wait a bit, and soon you'll be listening to your favorite Taylor Swift hits.

### That's it for today!

I hope you enjoyed it and that it helped somehow 😁
